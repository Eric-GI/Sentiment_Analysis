Here are the steps you can follow to detect the sentiment associated with a particular tweet using machine learning:

Load the dataset into a pandas dataframe using pandas.read_csv() method.
Preprocess the data to clean it and remove unnecessary elements such as URLs, mentions, and special characters. You can use regular expressions to accomplish this.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Vectorize the tweets into numerical features using the CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer class from sklearn.feature_extraction.text.
Train a machine learning model on the training set. You can use algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Naive Bayes to classify the tweets.
Evaluate the accuracy of the trained model on the testing set.
Use the trained model to predict the sentiment associated with the tweet of your choice.
